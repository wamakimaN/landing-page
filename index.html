  <ol>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>javaScript</li>
    <li>jQuery</li>
  </ol>

  <div id="about">
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p><strong>So you must be wondering, what innspired me to join a programming school?</strong> I feel that programming has become socialised since people always work in teams and so i wanted to learn in an environment that deleloped my social development skills.</p>
    <P><strong>Why Moringa School then?</strong>after going through several programming school websites, Moringa's stood out due to it's polished state. "They must really know what they're doing.", I thought to myself. I found that their unique learning system i.e Blended Learning resonated well with my style of learning.</P>
    <p><strong>What do I expect to gain from this experience? </strong>By the time am through with my studies i want to become a world class software engineer and hopefully own a software company. At the least , I want to enjoy the learning journey as i discover new things.</p>
    <p>Away from programming am also a decent football player but you'll probably not hear me make the football headlines.</p>
    <p>I am fascinated by space exploration and am  sort of a geek for it. The size of the universe compared to the size of the Earth really puts things into perespective.</p>

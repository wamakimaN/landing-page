      <h2>Hello There</h2>
      <p>My name is Moses Wamakima and am a junior developer currently studying at <strong>Moringa School</strong>.
        During
        my stay in Moringa I will learn the following <em>programming languages</em>:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>javaScript</li>
        <li>jQuery</li>
      </ol>

      <div id="about">
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p><strong>So you must be wondering, what innspired me to join a programming school?</strong> I feel that
          programming has become socialised since people always work in teams and so i wanted to learn in an environment
          that deleloped my social development skills.</p>
        <P><strong>Why Moringa School then?</strong>after going through several programming school websites, Moringa's
          stood
          out due to it's polished state. "They must really know what they're doing.", I thought to myself. I found that
          their unique learning system i.e Blended Learning resonated well with my style of learning.</P>
        <p><strong>What do I expect to gain from this experience? </strong>By the time am through with my studies i want
          to
          become a world class software engineer and hopefully own a software company. At the least , I want to enjoy
          the
          learning journey as i discover new things.</p>
        <p>Away from programming am also a decent football player but you'll probably not hear me make the football
          headlines.</p>
        <p>I am fascinated by space exploration and am sort of a geek for it. The size of the universe compared to the
          size
          of the Earth really puts things into perespective.</p>
